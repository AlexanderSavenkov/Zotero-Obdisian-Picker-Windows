# Zotero/Scrivener picker

This allows you to call up a zotero picker from within Scrivener in Windows 10 using a windowspowershell script by leveraging the framework provided by the Better BibTeX zotero plugin.

... or in other words, it allows you to input a citation without leaving scrivener or touching a mouse! This will input scannable cite citation codes, using [the type of picker you see in word and libreoffice](http://mossiso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/zotero-new-view-find-citation.png), which can later be scanned by Zotero to create live citations. It takes a bit set-up but is well worth the effort when you are done!

## Prerequisites
This script has only been tested on Windows 10(x64), using zotero 5 and Scrivener 1 for windows. Will test with Scrivener 3 when released later in 2018.

This script also requires that you install autolt (see link below). This is to get around a Zotero bug in which the picker does not always appear on top when first called - unfortunately none of the in-built powershell commands did the trick. I will probably remove these elements in the future if this Zotero bug is fixed.

## Instructions
1. Install the [RTF/ODT plugin for zotero](https://zotero-odf-scan.github.io/zotero-odf-scan/).

2. Install the [Better BibTeX plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/)

3. Install [Autolt.](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). As this script only requires the Cmdlet functions this installs, feel free to uninstall the extra editor etc that also come with it when you are done.

3. Download the **zotpick.7z file** from this website.

4. Unzip the folder

5. Place this folder somewhere out of the way (a.k.a somewhere you won't accidentally delete it someday). I suggest leaving it in the Scrivener folder located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Scrivener but it doesn't actually matter, as long as you can find it later

6. In scrivener, open the **Options** window (F12). Under the **general** tab, click on *choose* under the *bibliography/citation Manager* section.

7. Navigate to wherever you previously placed the folder. This will appear empty at first. Click on the dropdown menu to change file type, to display **.lnk** files. 

8. Select the file named **zotpick-scannablecite - Shortcut.lnk** and press okay. Exit the Options window.

9. Cite away! **The zotero application must be open for this script to work** You should now be able to call the picker by using the keyboard shortcut for bibliogrphy/citation set by Scrivener.  You can check what the preset is by clicking the **Format** menu and seeing what is listed next to **bibliography/citations.** Search for the source you need by typing in author name or title, as you would using word or libreoffice plugin. You can also add a colon and a number to include the page number. Press enter when you are done. VoilÃ ! 

> *Note: The preset shortcut in Scrivener didn't work for me, I think because there were two key combinations set for some reason... I fixed this problem by changing the keyboard shortcut under **tools/options/keyboard**. Search for "citations" and edit the keyboard shortcut as you please. I recommend CTR+G*

10. When ready, compile scrivener into an odt file. Scan using Zotero as detailed on [this wepage](https://catherinepope.com/how-to-use-zotero-with-scrivener-part-2/).

## Customizing script

This script is currently set up to output the scannable cite format. In order to change format, open up the scrivener-picker.ps1 file in a text editor (will open in notepad by default). Look for this line:

`$ref = invoke-expression "curl 'http://localhost:23119/better-bibtex/cayw?format=scannable-cite'"`

You can edit the section which says "scannable-cite" to any of the formats listed [on the Better BibTeX webpage](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/cayw/
)

I have had some issues with formatted-citation (which outputs whatever style you have set as quick-cite in Zotero) not outputting italics (such as in book titles). I suspect this has to do with the encoding that Better BibTeX outputs, but I'm not 100% sure. Other styles that do not require rich text encoding should be fine. If you are able to solve the issue with italics, please let me know!

## Issues

If you having issues with this script, please let me know in the issues tab on this page. I only have basic level programming skills, so I can't promise an instant fix, but I might be able to address some concerns, or at the very least point you in the right direction.
